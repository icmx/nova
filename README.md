# Nova (2017-2018)

Angular 2+ components library example. This was originally made in 2017-2018 mostly in educatuion purposes. It's not really perfect project but I decided to save it here just in case. My frontend skills became way better since then by the way.

Library includes:

  - Button
  - Datepicker
  - Dropdown (with typeahead)
  - Field
  - Filedrop
  - Menu, MenuItem
  - Radio
